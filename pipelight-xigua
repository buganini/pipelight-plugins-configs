# Enables a diagnostic mode which might be helpful to find an
# error in the configuration or installation.
# To get the error messages go to: http://fds-team.de/pipelight
#
# Information for advanced users: The diagnostic page embeds the plugin
# of type "application/x-pipelight-error" to trigger the output of some
# debug information. The plugin cannot be triggered if everything is
# working, so this only affects users with a broken installation.
# The debug output will include paths on the local filesystem and the
# linux distribution used. If you don't want to leak this information
# accidentially in case of a broken installation please either uninstall
# Pipelight or disable the diagnosticMode. [default: false]

# In order to support browsers without NPAPI timer support
# (like Midori) we've implemented a fallback to
# NPN_PluginThreadAsyncCall. In the default configuration
# a timer based approach is preferred over async calls and the
# plugin decides by itself which method to use depending on the
# browser capabilities. Setting the following option to true
# forces the plugin to use async calls. This might be mainly
# useful for testing the difference between both event handling
# approaches. [default: false]

#
# The opera browser claims to provide timer functions, but they
